## AI-Based 2-Player Pacman-Inspired Simulation

### Description

This project is a Python-based simulation of a 2-player game on an 8x8 board. Players take turns moving to their adjacent cells, trying to collect coins to score points. The game incorporates AI techniques such as game tree search to make strategic decisions. Additionally, players can earn bonus points by collecting 3 or more coins in a row. The game is visualized in a 3D environment using Webots.

### Features

-   2-player game simulation
-   8x8 board with coins
-   Game tree search for decision-making
-   Bonus score for collecting coins in a row
-   3D simulation using Webots to visualize the game

## To run the simulation

## 1. Command Line Simulation

Run the following command in the terminal to simulate the game. The output will be displayed in the output.txt file for easy viewing.

```bash
python3 main.py > output.txt
```

## 2. Webots Simulation

In Webots app, open the `worlds` folder and select the `pacman.wbt` file. Then, run the simulation to visualize the game in 3D.
